## What are 3D objects?

### Jumping from 2D to 3D
We learned the methods of calculating the area covered by a surface in different shapes.We can draw all of the shapes in a sheet of paper and they cover space in that sheet only. But very rarely will things look like a sheet of paper in the real world. Have you seen a real triangle around yourself? Or maybe a rectangle? You may say yes but they aren't perfect rectangles. There is very little thickness of a sheet of paper as well.

2.1
You must be familiar with the object above, it's called the Rubik’s cube. It has 6 flat surfaces and all of them are squares. The faces span in three different directions. It means that we cant see all the squares at once without rotating the orientation of the cube. 

<img src="2_2_rubik's_cube_axes.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.2
 
What is the size of the object?
If we are to describe the size of this object, we must define the measurement of the length of the sides in each direction. These measurements are called dimensions and since the object spans over three directions, this object has three dimensions. So these types of objects are called 3D objects.

We analyze 3D object with property known as face. Faces are the surfaces of the 3D object. For example in that Rubik's cube, there are 6 squares that are the faces of the cube. Any face will span in two directions only. For example, if we place the cube such that we see the pink and green lines only and not the white line, we find that the squares are colored in red only and feels like the whole cube is red since we cant see other faces. Similar thing happens when we try and see the white and green lines only, it seems like the whole cube is blue. In conclusion, there are six ways of looking at the cube: front, back, top, bottom, left and right and hence there are six faces of a cube and they all have different colors. We can only see three of those faces from this picture, whereas the other three are hidden on the other side and we can see them by rotating the cube only.

We can see that there are 9 smaller squares on the each of the 6 faces. We also see that each of the squares is of the same size. As you remember we measure surfaces with the number of squares that can cover the respective surface. If we look at the red square face that can be seen from the front, there are 9 red squares. Likewise there are nine squares on each of the faces.

<img src="2_3_rubik's_cube_9squares.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.3

If each square has a unit surface area, then the red face covers an area equivalent to 9 squares. Like the red face, it is the same with the blue, yellow and other remaining faces. Each face has an area of 9 square units. There are six different faces on that cube which means 9 has to be added 6 times. If all of the squares are counted then there will be 9+9+9+9+9+9 or 54 squares.

The value 54 square units which we obtained is the total surface area of the cube. Total surface area is defined as the sum of area covered by all visible faces of an object. Visible faces mean all faces that are on the object, even the ones that can be viewed by rotating the cube towards another direction.

We can analyze which surfaces are part of the total surface area by questioning ourselves “if this object has to be covered with a sheet of paper, which surfaces are required to cover or can be covered?” or "If this object is painted, which surfaces will be covered in paint?"
If we have a 3D object with faces that are of different shapes, then we find the area of those shapes and add them together for its total surface area.

Each of the square faces meets at a straight edge. Edges means we can draw a line that joins two faces such as blue and yellow faces, yellow and red face, red and blue faces and so on. The edges are highlighted below. There are 12 edges on a cube; only 9 can be seen in the figure below. 
<img src="2_4_rubik's_cube_edges.gif" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.4
  
The edges meet at certain points lying on the extreme areas on the face of the cube. Those pointy areas are called corners. There are 8 corners in the cube of which 7 are visible and 1 is not. There are three edges intersecting at each corner. The number of edges and corners in a particular object is dependent on the number of faces it has.

2.5

If the three sides of a cube aren't equal to each other then such an object is known as a cuboid. The method of finding the total surface area of a cuboid is given later.

### What are polyhedra?
We introduced 3D faces with objects that have flat faces. But, faces may not always be flat in a 3D object. 

What is the difference between the shapes of the two batteries that can be seen in the figure below? 
<img src="2_6_and_2_7_battery.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.6 2.7


Apart from the height of the two batteries, we can see that the outer surfaces of the two batteries aren't the same. We can clearly see that one of them has a curved type surface whereas the other has all of its surface flat. Curved surface is the reason that when we look at the battery (on the left) from the top, we see a circle. 
<img src="2_8_cyindrical_battery_top_view.png" width="100" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.8

Polyhedra are 3D objects that have flat surfaces only and the battery shown on the right is a polyhedra while the other battery is not. Polyhedra in itself is of two types. We categorize them based on the shape of the faces that the object is made up of.

Let’s observe two types of polyhedra. 
<img src="2_9_and_2_10_polyhedra_pyramid_cuboid.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.9 2.10 

You must be familiar with the pyramids of Egypt, what shapes are the different faces of the pyramid? Well, one thing is certain they contain flat faces only. That is why it is a type of polyhedron.

Look at the two wooden boxes in the above figure. The figure on the left side above resembles a pyramid whereas the one on the right is a box/chest similar to how a Rubik’s cube shape is but with rectangles. Such objects are known as cuboids. 
The pyramid-type box on the left has triangular faces attached with one another while the box on the right has rectangular faces only. The shape of the chest is cuboid and it consists of rectangles only. 

#### It depends on how we look at the objects
If we look at the object straight from the direction shown with the blue arrow, we are certain that we will see a rectangle, and the thickness of the box behind it won't be visible.

<img src="2_11_polyhedra_rectangle.png" width="200" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.11 

Do you remember any object that is just like a rectangle? 
If you have then you must have noticed that even the thinnest of objects are not perfect 2D figures because they have some thickness as well. The figure below shows a door that looks like a rectangle from the front but has ‘t’ thickness. 

<img src="2_12_door_two views.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.12

We have no doubt that the front of the door is rectangular. We see the rectangle at all times when the door is closed but when the door is opened and we observe from the same direction as shown in the figure, it feels like the door is trapezium.

<img src="2_13_door_view_open.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.13 

That is normally the case with a lot of 3D objects. We don't see actual shapes from all directions. For instance, have a look at the cuboid below which is made from rectangles yet all of them look like parallelograms.


### What is a volume? 

<img src="2_14_cuboid_iso.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.14

As area gives the space occupied or covered by a 2D object, we have a similar quantity for 3D objects as well. As we know 3D means 3-dimensional objects that occupy some space in three different directions. 
<img src="2_15_rectangle_extruded.gif" width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.15

For example, we have a rectangle of dimensions ℓ and b as shown in the figure. If we copy the same rectangle in the third direction shown by the arrow and join them all, we find that it makes up a box. We extend the rectangles upto ‘h’ units which is also known as the height of the prism. If ℓ x b was the area covered by one rectangular face, there are multiple rectangles upto ‘h’ units. Thus we have to add that same area h times.  
These types of 3D objects make themselves seem like a collection of the same shape and same size polygons are known as prisms.
We use term "cross section" to define a shape that can be obtained by cutting a 3D object. If we cut the box perpendicularly to the direction of the extension, then we get that rectangle of dimensions ℓ and b. It doesnt matter where we cut as long as we are perpendicular we get the same rectangle. Cross sectional area is the area of that face. The cross-sectional area in any prism remains the same and doesnt change throughout. 

Let’s move to the pyramid shape mentioned earlier. 
<img src="2_29_pyramid_extruded.gif" width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.29

There are four traingles (2 triangles are on the other side) that are inclined to each other and all of them are standing on one square face. Therefore, this is a square-based pyramid in which there are 4 triangular faces that join the sides of the square base to a point also called the Apex. When observing from bottom to the top, it may seem like the square gradually decreases its size to shrink itself to a point. There are 8 edges and 5 corners in this pyramid.

Pyramids can also have base of other shapes. A hexagonal base pyramid has six triangular faces that join the base hexagon with the Apex. A hexagonal pyramid has 6 triangles whereas a hexagonal prism has 6 rectangles. 
<img src="2_30_hexagonal_pyramid.png" width="150" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
2.30

### Total surface area of pyramids
Since the total surface area of any object is the sum of area of all faces.
Total surface area of pyramid= Area of 4 triangles + area of square

<img src="6_1_all_faces_of_pyramid.gif" width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
6.1


We found in prism that the number of faces in it increases as the number of sides of the base. The same applies for pyramid as well, the number of triangular faces increase as the number of sides in the base increases. A pyramid with base that has 6 sides will have 6 triangular faces. If the base has 7 sides, then there will be 7 triangular faces and so on. 

We know that we can find the area of any triangle by multiplying base of the triangle with its height. 

Each triangular face has its own base and height. We can measure height of each triangle along that face. We call that height slant height because the triangle itself is inclined. If the apex of the pyramid lies directly above the center of the base, then the pyramid is a right pyramid. If a right pyramid has a base with all sides equal to each other, then the base and height pair in each triangle is the same. 

<img src="6_2_pyramids.jpg" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
6.2
The general formulae for both the lateral and total surface areas of the right pyramid with a regular base are:
Total surface area = area of all triangular faces + base area
=1/2 x (sum of the bases of triangular faces) x slant height of prism + base area
= (1/2) x perimeter of the base x slant height of prism + base area
If we require the lateral surface area only, then we remove the base area from the formula of the total surface area.  
Lateral surface area= (1/2) x perimeter of the base x slant height of the pyramid

The actual height of the pyramid is distance between the center of the base and apex. The actual height of any pyramid is less than the slant height in most cases. 

### The volume of pyramid
For finding the volume of the pyramid, there are several formulae derived based on fractional volume concept by comparing the relative volumes of a prism and pyramid that have same base. In most cases, it is found that the volume of the pyramid is ⅓ times the volume of the prism of the same base and height. It is because three pyramids of the same volume can fit inside the prism of same dimensions.

For example, 
The given pyramid and prism are of the same shape and size base that is a square of length 'ℓ' and the vertical height of both is 'h'.

<img src="6_3_prism_and_pyramid.jpg" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
6.3

The volume of prism = area of base x height

=length x length x height

Then the volume of the pyramid is ⅓ of that of the prism of the same base and height.
The volume of the pyramid = ⅓ x length x length x height
