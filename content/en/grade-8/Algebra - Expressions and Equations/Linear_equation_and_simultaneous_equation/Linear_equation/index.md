### Equations expressing relation between two quantities
In the previous grades, we had familiarized ourselves with the equation involving a single variable. We learned about the different strategies used to solve it. Now we will learn about equations that have more than one variables in them or to be more specific; two variable equations. 

Solving equations with many variables is also similar to the process of solving single-variable equations. Similar in the sense that laws of equality are used here as well. 

Why do we use more than one variable in the equation?
More than one variable is required in cases when there are more than one quantities that are unknown to us. 
The assumption is that the two variables that are unknown must have some kind of relation between theselves. 

For example, I am 3 years older than my brother. It means if I am 22, he must be 19, if i am 55, then he must be 52 and so on. We may choose to use any of the values but one thing is certain; that the gap between two ages is 3 years and that is it.
However, when we change one of the variables, the other changes too. 

Let's assume a condition where I eat twice the number of donuts as my brother eats. 

If my brother eats 2, I will eat 4.

If he eats 3, I will eat 6.

If he eats 7, I will eat 14, and so on. 


Even though we know that I eat double of what he eats, we still can't tell what is the actual number of donuts eaten. We already know that when we are uncertain about the exact value of the quantities, we use a placeholder variable that is generally a letter. But here are two quantities that we have in this case and this means we can use separate variables such as  ùë• and y or a and b or ‚àÖ and ‚àÜ so on. Any letter of the symbol can be unless they already denote some constant number. 

Let's take c and d for the donuts eaten by me and my brother respectively. 
Thus c=2d because d is smaller than c and to make the small number equal to the larger number, we multiply d with 2.
we try to find out what particular values of the variables satisfy both sides of the equation. 

Taking into account the relation, 2 and 4, 3 and 6 and 7 and 14 are the different pair values of c and d. We say that these values satisfy the given equation and they are the solution to the given equation. 
Now when we think about solving an equation,  Here we can see that the two sides can be balanced by using different values.

Also what can be seen here is that when d is doubled c is also doubled, when c is tripled, d is also tripled etc.

Relationships of these kinds where the value of one variable increases with the same factor as with which the other variable increases is known as proportional relationship. That means when one quantity is doubled, another quantity that is related to that quantity is also doubled. The same phenomenon is observed when the quantities are multiplied by 3, 4, or any number. 
In such cases, there is a term known as the rate of proportionality. In equation c=2d, the rate of proportionality is 2. That means no matter how big or small the value of d is, c will always be double of that or we can say whatever the value of c is, d will always be half of that. 

Proportional relationships always pass through origin or (0, 0). That means when one quantity is 0, the other is 0 as well. 

We can also see that when ùë• increases by 1, y always increases by 2 which is true but this happens in other linear relationships that are not proportional as well. 



### Using graph to understand equations
The rate of proportionality is an important factor in the relationship between two quantities. 
Let's take one more example of a similar type. 
If your friend is traveling on a scooter at an average speed of 25 miles per hour and you are traveling at 40 miles per hour speed in your bike. How do you compare the relationship between time and distance traveled in the two vehicles if you both were to start at the same position? 

For the scooter, it travels 25 miles in the first hour, 50 in two hours, 75 in three hours, etc.
If the time in hours and distance traveled in miles are taken to be two quantities denoted by ùë• and y respectively then it can be written as y=25ùë•. We can show the corresponding positions of the bike and scooter and connect them with a line as shown in the figure. 
All the corresponding positions of the scooter with respect to the time can be shown with the help of a graph as shown below. The distance traveled is shown in the vertical y-axis whereas the horizontal ùë•-axis shows the time taken to travel that distance.

On the other hand, your bike travels an average of 40 miles in the first hour, will have traveled 80 in two hours, and so on. The graph can be shown in blue color as below. In a similar manner, we can find the equation for the bike as y=40ùë•.

3.8

When we combine the two graphs, we get to see that bike will always be ahead of the scooter or travel more distance at the same time because of the higher rate of covering distance (rate is speed). That is also seen in the graph as the lines dont meet at any point after the origin.

If there are two relationships just like the above case whose rates have to be compared, then the rate of change is very important. The rate of change for the pink graph is 25 miles per hour whereas it is 40 miles for the blue graph. 

While writing the relation we get,

Distance traveled = rate x time 

Thus the rate of traveling that is 25 and 40 in the previous case is the constant values that multiply by the time elapsed. Here the time elapsed is the independent variable and the distance traveled is the dependent variable. 

The same relation can be written in reverse, but the constant would change in that case. That is normally done for convenience with regards to the value of the variable we know and the one we dont know.  Thus, the placing of the dependent and independent variables in the equation can be done as per the need. 

For example for the scooter

y=25ùë• if we want to know about the distance traveled.

ùë•=y/25 if we want to know about the time taken

If we compare the time taken in the two cases,
ùë•=y/25
ùë•=y/40

The coefficient of y in the first case is greater because 1/25>1/40 thus the scooter will take longer time in comparison to the bike for covering the same distance. 

Also, the common point in both the relations which was the origin (zero distance traveled when time=0) in this comparison can be elsewhere. 
y=25ùë• has an initial value of zero (when ùë•=0, y=0), y=25ùë•+10 has an initial value of 10 (when ùë•=0, y=10). The initial value is the point on which the y-axis is cut. 
When the initial values are different, the point of intersection is away from the origin.

One of the common forms of depicting the linear relationship is y=mùë• + c

In that, comparing y= 25ùë• + 10 with that, we get 25 in place of m and 10 in place of c. They have been called the rate of change and initial value in this chapter till now. There are more logical terms used especially when the relation is plotted in the graph. The rate of change is known as the slope and the initial value is known as the y-intercept. The rate is called the slope because it gives an idea of how steep a graph is. The more the slope, the steeper the graph is. Then there is the y-intercept which is the point where the graph cuts the y-axis.
