What is meant by transforming objects?
Transforming any object is the process of changing the orientation or location or size for different applications. These changes are done through different mechanisms. There are two types of transformations: rigid and non-rigid.
Rigid transformations
The main question is why do we need to transform shapes? Letâ€™s focus on rigid transformations to be specific. Rigid transformation is the process of changing the orientation or location of any object. Have you ever wondered how the shape and size of all iPhones are the same? It may sound so stupid to question; the reason being so simple. But it is very important for Apple to make each of their phones of the same model to be the same shape and size. In other words, we can say that the shape and size of an iPhone have to be transformed into other raw materials so that more phones can be made. 
Rigid transformations are those processes in which the shape and size of the object are conserved even after the transformation. Such transformations show some kind of change in the shape's orientation (how a shape is placed on the plane) or location or both. Reflection, rotation, and translation are examples of rigid transformations. 
When the shape and size of an object are the same, then such a case is defined as congruence. If we want to find out if two shapes are congruent, then there should be a rigid transformation (or two or more) that can be used to transform one of the objects into the other. In converse, we can say that an object and image formed through single or multiple rigid transformations are congruent to each other. 
Some of these kinds of transformations with real-life objects are shown below.

8.1

The building has its image reflected in the water as seen in the photograph. The topmost part of the building is reflected in the bottom-most part of the image.

8.2 

The heart-shaped candy is rotated since the orientation of the top curvy part changes its direction.

8.3

The queen chess piece is being moved (translated) on the board. 
Non-rigid transformations do not conserve the object's shape or size (or both). Dilation is an example of non-rigid transformation, where the shape remains the same but the size of the object changes.  
We will learn more about reflection, rotation, translation, and dilation going further.
