Reflection
When you look at yourself or any object in the mirror, you see your reflection, which looks like you, but the orientation is the opposite sidewise. The things or parts that are actually to your right are seen to be on the left. While the things on the left seem to be on the right in the mirror. What is seen is your reflection or the image. The other thing that can be noticed is that when you are nearer to the mirror, your image also seems nearer and when you are far from the mirror, your image also seems far from the mirror This is one type of rigid transformation used in geometry. 
Reflecting on an object is dependent on a specific line called the axis of reflection. This is like the mirror in the above case. This line tells us about the new image's orientation and distance from the original object.
You can see that we first make the triangle ABC. Now, keeping the vertical axis as the axis of reflection, we first make point A', which is the reflected point of A. This should be at an equal distance from the axis of reflection as point A is from the axis of reflection, 2 units here. Note that you also should draw a line from A to the axis, which is perpendicular to the axis. The 2 units from the axis to point A' should also be in a direction perpendicular to the axis. We do the same for points B and C to get B' and C'.

8.4 and 8.5 


Think about how you are at an equal distance from the mirror and so is your reflection! This is the same thing.
The objects and images are generally differentiated on the basis of diagram labels. Images are labeled with a dash on the letters, the reflected point of A is A', as we have seen above. 
Here are some images showing objects and their reflections, with the different axis of reflection.

The perpendicular distance of the different points of line AB from the axis is the same as that of image A'B'. The axis is oblique and it isnt easy to measure the distance between the object and the image compared to the case before. Oblique distance is measured diagonally such that the lines joining the object and the image and axis are perpendicular to each other. The red and yellow lines join objects A and B with their corresponding images A’ and B’. The axis shown in blue lies midway through those lines. 
One more example of reflection is given below.

8.7

We clearly see that the axis of reflection (red line) affects how the image of the object is reflected. If the object is near the axis, its image will be near as well. If the object is far from the axis of reflection, then the image is far as well. 
Reflections are also used as a medium to understand how symmetric a given object is. An object is symmetric if an image can be divided into two parts that are identical. Let’s look at this some more.
Symmetry by reflection
The axis of reflection that we learned about before can be helpful in telling us if an object is symmetric or not. The axis of symmetry can be thought of as the line of symmetry. 
For example, let's observe the given isosceles triangle. We can see that the left part and right part are exact copies of each other, and we can think of the left part to be flipped/reflected around the straight line to get the right part, and vice versa. If we fold the part lying to the left of the line, then the part lying on the right is completely overlapped.

8.8

This idea of line symmetry can help us explain the properties of different 2D objects. 
Different objects have different lines of symmetry and different numbers of these as well. 
If we look at an equilateral triangle, we can find three such lines that the figure is symmetric about.

Likewise, a square has four lines of symmetry as seen below. However, the same cannot be said about rectangles. The two lines of symmetry on the bottom two figures cannot be observed in a rectangle.

Let's see what happens with a rectangle if we fold it in half along the diagonal. The bottom part does not completely overlap with the top part but instead overlaps with the blue dotted part shown. You can test this out with a rectangular sheet of paper and fold it through the diagonal line.

8.11

Thus, a rectangle only has two lines of symmetry; the horizontal and the vertical.

The circle has an infinite number of symmetric lines. 12 of them are shown in the figure. Folding the circle along any of these lines will overlap the two halves completely.
