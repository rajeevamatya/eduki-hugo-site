## Objects with same volume may have different surface areas


Cuboids that have the same volume can look different and have different surface areas.

For example, Cube A and Cube B have the same volume but Cube A has a larger surface area than Cube B. 
Volume of cube A = 2 x 2 x 1 = 4 cubic units 
Volume of cube B = 4 x 1 x 1 = 4 cubic units
Total surface area of cube A= 2 (2x2 + 2x1 + 2x1) = 16 square units 
Total surface area of cube B= 2 (4x1 + 4x1 + 1x1) = 12 square units
This means that it would take more paint to color Cube A than Cube B.




This applies in reverse as well, two objects that have the same surface area can occupy different volumes.

To calculate the surface area of a given figure, we need to count the number of visible faces. In this figure with six cubes, not all of the faces are visible. We need to count the visible faces of each cube separately. Note that each square has a side of 1 square unit. 
Here, the dark blue cube has five visible faces because one face is hidden by the yellow cube. 
Visible faces of the dark blue cube = 6-1 = 5 
The yellow cube has two of its faces (bottom and top) hidden that are attached to the dark and light blue cubes.
Visible faces of the yellow cube = 6-2 = 4 
The light blue cube has two of its faces (bottom and top) hidden that are attached to the yellow and maroon cubes.
Visible faces of the light blue cube = 6-2 = 4 
The red cube has two of its faces (left and right) hidden that are attached to the light blue and black cubes.
Visible faces of the red cube = 6-2 = 4 
The black cube has its right part hidden since it is attached to the red cube. 
Visible faces of the black cube = 6-1 = 5
The maroon cube has its top part hidden since it is attached to the light blue cube. Visible faces of the maroon cube = 6-1 = 5 
By counting all of the visible faces as one square unit, we can find the total surface area of the figure.
Total number of faces visible in the given figure is = (5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5) = 27 square units
If we divide the object into two parts, the surface area of the cubes will increase because more faces will become visible.

However, the total volume of the object will stay the same because we are not adding or removing any cubes.
