## Surface area of prism with rectangular bases

To find the surface area of a cuboid (a 3D shape with six rectangular faces), we look at each face separately. Just like how we find the area of a flat shape, we add up the areas of all the faces to get the surface area of the cuboid.

Each direction of the cuboid has two faces that are the same size. There are six rectangles in total, with two on the front and back faces (colored yellow), two on the top and bottom faces (colored blue), and two on the sides (colored pink). The faces that have the same dimensions are the same size.

To find the total surface area of the cuboid, we add up the areas of all six rectangles. 
Total surface area = ℓ x b + b x h + ℓ x h + ℓ x b + b x h + ℓ x h = 2 (ℓ x b + b x h + ℓ x h)
We use this formula for rectangular prisms or cuboids. If the cuboid is a cube (where all sides are the same length), we can simplify the formula to 6ℓ^2 or 6b^2 or 6h^2 (simply replace two of the sides with the third).

### Surface area of prisms with other bases

Here are some cool prisms with a different shape for their base.


<img src="2_45_pentagnal_prism.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

This prism has a pentagon base that's highlighted in light pink. There are 5 rectangular faces that connect the two pentagonal faces.

This prism has a quadrilateral base that's highlighted in pink. There are 4 rectangular faces that connect the two quadrilateral faces.

<img src="2_25_prism2_with_dimensions.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

To find the total surface area of the given prism, we add up the area of all 6 faces (basically all faces present in any prism). We can use this formula: Total surface area = 2 x base area + area of four rectangles.

<img src="2_26_prism2_with_all_faces.gif" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
Let’s say the sides of the quadrilateral are a1, a2, a3, and a4. The rectangles have the same height as the prism (h units) and their width is equal to the sides of the base shown in the above image with yellow color. 
We can find the total area of the rectangles by multiplying the length and height of each rectangle and adding them together. 
The area of the rectangles =  a1 x h + a2 x h + a3 x h + a4 x h = (a1 + a2 + a3 +a4) x h 


The perimeter of the base is the sum of all sides, thus a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 is the perimeter of the quadrilateral (the base). 
Area of rectangles = perimeter of the base x height 
Even if the shape has more than four sides, we can still use the same formula to find the area of the rectangles. To find the total surface area of the shape, we need to add the area of the rectangles to the area of the bases. 
The formula for total surface area = perimeter of the base x height + 2 x base area
=  p x h + 2A. 


The expression p x h is called the lateral surface area. This includes the area of all the faces of the shape except for the bases (essentially the rectangles). So, to find the total surface area of the shape, we add the lateral surface area to twice the area of the bases.
