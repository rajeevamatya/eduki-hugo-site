## Polygon
A polygon that has four sides is called a quadrilateral. But what is a polygon?


We have already seen triangles and rectangles, so it is obvious that lines can combine to form closed shapes. And based on the number of lines used, we get different shapes. These shapes are called polygons.


We can understand the word polygon by breaking it down into two parts. ‘Poly’ means plural and ‘gon’ means the number of sides or simply sides. So simply, a polygon is something that has multiple sides! 


Some things to note about polygons:
To be a polygon, the shape must be a closed figure made of straight lines only. So a circle is not a polygon and so is any shape that is made up of curved lines.
The straight lines are joined end to end and no line can cross the other. These lines are the sides of a polygon. 
Image 1_39





The shape shown crosses in the middle, so it is not a polygon.


So how many sides do you need to make a polygon? 1? 2? 10? 100?


The maximum number can be any number of sizes. You can keep adding more and more sides, and it will be a polygon as long as the sides connect end to end (or intersect!). 


But what about the smallest number of sides? Let’s try it out, starting with one side.
1_40







Well, that clearly is not a polygon since a closed shape is not formed. 


What about two sides?


Image 1_41



It seems like two sides are not enough either. The two lines cannot form a closed shape. 


When we try out three sides, we know that it finally is able to make a closed shape - a triangle!


So, it seems like we cannot form a polygon with less than 3 sides. 


Polygons have names based on the number of sides they have.
A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle, a polygon with 4 sides is a quadrilateral, a polygon with 5 sides is a pentagon, and so on. 


A polygon that consists of ‘n’ sides can be decomposed into ‘n-2’ triangles. If we have to find the area of the polygon, we can find the area of each of the triangles and add them together. However. there may be smarter ways of decomposing the same polygon into other shapes such as rectangles or squares which is totally dependent on the type of polygon. 

### Area of parallelogram


So, we have looked at a rectangle, which is a polygon with 4 sides. 
You are also familiar with a square, which is basically a rectangle but with all sides equal. But, there are other four sides shapes that do not have right angles. 


To generalize, all four-sided polygons are called quadrilaterals. We have already looked at how to find the area of a rectangle, which is a special type of polygon. Now, we’ll look at another one.


A quadrilateral that has opposite sides equal and parallel to each other is a parallelogram. This sounds like a rectangle, right? A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram, where all angles are 90°. But when the angles are not 90°, we have a shape with only opposite angles equal and opposite sides parallel and equal. A parallelogram is shown below.
1_42



How do we go about finding the area of such a shape? There’s always the option of simply counting the square units present inside it. But it would be easier to find a formula that could be used easily (and spend less time counting squares). 


For that, lets decompose and rearrange the parallelogram into a rectangle so we can use the formula. Let’s see if we can achieve that.


We can decompose the parallelogram in a way that we get a right-angled triangle and then move that triangle from one side of the parallelogram to the other to complete the rectangle. Here, the triangle on the right is moved to the left side.
1_43



After the rearrangement of the decomposed triangle, we obtain the rectangle (square) of 4 by 4 size as shown below. 
1_44 
  
1_45

Once we have a square (rectangle), we can easily find the area by multiplying the length and width, both of which are 4 units in measurement. 
Area of rectangle = 4 x 4 = 16 square units




So we essentially used the formula for rectangles to find the area of a parallelogram. Can we then say that they have the same formula? Let’s confirm and look at how to relate the formula of the area of the rectangle with that of the parallelogram. 




Let’s look at another parallelogram that has one of its sides horizontal 4 units and horizontal parallel lines at a distance of 4 units. 
1_46



            
We’ll do the same thing we did before and get a rectangle (square) of length and height 4 units each.
1_47  


         



This means the area is the same. Strange right? The two parallelograms do not look alike but somehow have the same area.


Let’s look at what actually is similar between the two. 


The base is clearly the same - 4 units. And the horizontal parallel lines are at the same distance - 4 units. 


The only difference between the two parallelograms discussed before is the angle of inclination of the sides. 


Since we used the concept of decomposition and rearrangement for getting the rectangle from the parallelogram in both cases, we can be sure that the areas of both figures are also the same. 
If we have a look at the parallelogram again, we find that the area is dependent on one of the sides of the parallelogram (shown in the black dotted line) and the distance between it and its opposite side (shown in the red dotted line). The distance, between the side, measures 4 units, and its opposite side is 4 units as well. They are shown in the figure below. 
1_48

The horizontal side which remains common in both the parallelogram and the rectangle is called the base. 
1_49



The vertical arrow (shown in red) that gives the distance between the base and the side parallel to the base is called height.


So, if we want to find the area of a rectangle, we simply use the same formula as that of a rectangle. 


Thus the area of a parallelogram = base x height


What we can conclude is that the rectangle we get after decomposing and rearranging multiple parallelograms will remain the same as long as the base of each parallelogram is the same and the distance between this base and its opposite side is always the same. The inclination of the parallelogram does not have an effect on the final rectangle we get. 


Let’s call that perpendicular distance “the height” of the parallelogram. 


This means a parallelogram that has the same base and the same height as a rectangle will also have the same area.


We can also say that the area of a parallelogram is the same as the rectangle which is standing on the base and enclosed within the same parallel lines. 


Here is an example showing multiple parallelograms and a rectangle having an area of 15 square units. The distance between the parallel lines, which is the height, does not change even though the sides become more inclined.  All of them have a base of 3 units and a height of 5 units.


Therefore, as concluded earlier, the area of each parallelogram will be  3 units x 5 units = 15 square units.
1_50
 




A small note before we move on:


Is the base of the parallelogram always fixed? Does it always have to be the horizontal line?


Not necessarily. It can be any of the four sides of the parallelogram. What we need to keep in mind is that after we decide which side is the base, we use that to decide the height associated to it.  


One type of pairing of base and height is given below (this is the same parallelogram as before, so our original height and base were 4 units each). 
1_51



The base is now the inclined side (marked in black). Using this as the base, we know that the perpendicular distance between this base and the opposite side is the height. This is marked in red. 


The only condition that we must fulfill while drawing the base and height is that they must be making 90 degrees with each other and the base is one of the sides of the parallelogram. 


Keep in mind that this does not mean that the base is 4 units. (obviously, because it is inclined). The same goes for the height. But nonetheless, the product of the two will be equal to 16 square units. If you want to know the measurement of the base and height in that orientation, you can rotate the shape so it aligns with the unit squares given.

### Area of trapezium


When we have shapes that do not have any formula to find the area, we decompose and rearrange them, hopefully to a form that can give a formula. 


While applying decomposition we try to get familiar shapes such as rectangles or triangles or even a parallelogram so that it is easier to calculate their area using known formulae.


For example, the figure given here is a trapezium with one pair of opposite sides parallel to each other while the other pair is not parallel (the two vertical sides are parallel). 
1_61

The given trapezium can be decomposed into a triangle and a rectangle. We could find the area for this by using the formula for the triangle and the rectangles and adding the areas we get. 
1_62



But, we could add one more step, so only one formula is needed.


We can decompose the triangle at the midpoint of the height of the triangle. We then take the triangle formed to rearrange it such that we get a parallelogram (rectangle in this case). The process is demonstrated below. 
1_63



Now that we have a rectangle, we can either count the unit squares or simply use the length times width formula.
1_64 







The length and width of the figure are 4 and 3.5 units respectively, so the area = 3.5 x 4 =14 square units. 
Even if we count the number of square units that it occupies, it gives us 14 square units as the area. 




Trapeziums don’t always come with horizontal or vertical sides (like shown above) and in those cases, we can either decompose it into a triangle and a parallelogram or a rectangle and two triangles, whichever way is easier.
1_65

By using one of these ways, we can also find the formula for finding the area of a trapezium. We will use the technique of decomposing the trapezium into a parallelogram and a triangle. 


Before that, let’s first define the dimensions of the trapezium. 


The distances between the two parallel lines will be our height (denoted with ‘h’). 
Let’s also measure the parallel sides -> ‘a’ is the shorter side and ‘b’ is the longer side. 


Let’s now decompose the trapezium into a triangle and parallelogram as shown. For this, the line that decomposes the shape needs to be parallel to one side of the trapezium so we get a parallelogram. 
1_66


 


It should be obvious by now that the height of the parallelogram is the same as that of the triangle because they lie between the same parallel lines. This will be ‘h’, since that is the height of the trapezium.
1_67



Since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the base of the parallelogram can be taken as ‘a’ (as the smaller side of trapezium is ‘a’). 


For the triangle, the base is ‘b-a’ (since the longer side of the trapezium is b and we have removed a). 


[Base of the parallelogram + base of triangle = b
a + base of triangle = b
Therefore, the base of triangle = b - a]
1_68





Now, the area of the trapezium 
= area of the parallelogram + area of triangle
= base x height + ½ x base x height
= a x h + ½ x (b-a) x h
=h x (a + b/2 - a/2)
=h x (a/2 + b/2)
=½ x h x (a+b)


When writing in terms of the dimensions of the trapezium, we have the area of trapezium as:


= ½ x distance between parallel sides (or height) x sum of parallel sides


In case we are not looking to use the formula, we can use the decomposition process easily. We are already familiar with the process of finding the area for a rectangle, a parallelogram, or a triangle. So, the total area of the trapezium is the sum of the decomposed shapes whichever way we may do it.
