### Symbolic transformation
What is the point of learning expressions then?
The whole point of expressions is that complex contexts become simpler and concise with expressions. You may be wondering the expressions worked out till now have been simple and how simpler are we trying to get. 

It is true that the expressions mentioned till now have been very simple. But there are contexts in which the expressions has many operators to use. It means we may require addition as well, we may require subtraction as well, multiplication as well and so on. PEMDAS helps in determining which operator has to be written first and which has to be written last. 

PEMDAS is an acronym for 
Parenthesis for P 
Exponents for E, 
Multiplication for M, 
Division for D, 
Addition for A, and 
Subtraction for S 

For example, if we are to find “5 less than 7 times a number”. Here, “less” is used for subtraction operations whereas “times” is used to represent multiplication.

It says 7 has to be multiplied by a number that isn't known. Therefore the unknown number is determined first and then we multiply that by 7. Thus, a variable is represented by the letter 𝑥. Only after the multiplication, the subtraction operation is expressed. 
 
We write 7𝑥 - 5 in this context and not 7(𝑥 - 5). 7(𝑥 - 5) is applicable to the statement: "7 times 5 less than a number". 


Here any letter or symbol can be used in place of 𝑥 unless it means any other thing already. 
If we have to find out a number that is 5 lesser than 7 times 6 then we just plug in the value of the variable in the expression.
7 x 6 - 5 = 37

Another example of simplification is 
7 (4 + 5) ÷ 14 -82

First the Parenthesis
=7 x 10 ÷ 14 -82

Then the Exponent
=7 x 10 ÷ 14 -64

Then the Multiplication
=70 ÷ 14 -64

Then Division
=5 - 64

Then, it must have been Addition but its not available so Subtraction
=-59

We can operate with addition after subtraction or vice versa. The case is similar with multiplication and division. 

Expressions always tell something about a situation mathematically. The operators used in expressions are a direct translation of the meaning that a statement provides. 


For example, if an expression says double the amount of an unknown number, we first need a placeholder variable for the number and then multiply that by 2. If we choose the placeholder for that number as "g", then double the number becomes 2g. 


If an expression says that the amount of food cooked today is 50 kg less than that of yesterday and the amount of yesterday isn't known, then we need a placeholder variable to denote the unknown amount of food, double it and subtract 50 from it. 
amount of food cooked yesterday= f
double of that amount = 2 x f
50 less than double = 2 x f - 50

The expression would look something like 2f - 50 where f is the amount of food cooked yesterday.

We assumed a placeholder for food cooked yesterday as f and found the expression for food cooked today.
Based on how the expressions are formed, we can compare two expressions that contain same variable. 

For example, if we have two expressions 


The parts of expressions are separated by an operator. Operators can be addition “+”, subtraction “-”, multiplication “*” or “x”, division “÷” or “/”, the root “√” etc. Sometimes parts of an expression may not seem to use any operators, it is done in the cases of multiplication.

There are situations in which we require multiple placeholders for different quantities. Suppose you buy some number of blue, red and yellow t-shirts. If the number of blue t-shirts is “𝑥”, number of red t-shirts is “y” and number of yellow t-shirts is “z”, then the total number of t-shirts can be expressed as 𝑥 + y + z. If a blue t-shirt cost 3 dollars, a red one cost 2.5 dollars and a yellow one costs 2 dollars, the total cost of buying a blue T-shirt is 3𝑥, for the red one it's 2.5y and for the yellow one it's 2z dollars. 

Thus the total cost of all the t-shirts is 3𝑥+2.5y+2z dollars.
