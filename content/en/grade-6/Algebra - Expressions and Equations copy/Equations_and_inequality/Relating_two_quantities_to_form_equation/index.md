title: "Relation between two quantities"
description: "Equations can be used to relate two quantities. For example, the price of pens is twice the number of pens. The relationship can be represented by an equation. Similarly, the number of candies each student gets depends on the number of students. The relationship can be found using an equation. In some cases, the larger quantity is multiplied by a factor to equal the smaller quantity. The way the equation is written doesn't affect the relationship between the quantities. Another example is the height of a window, which is 6 inches less than the width. The relationship can be represented by an equation."

### Relating two quantities for making an equation
Equations are also used with two variables to show how two quantities depend on each other. 
For example, the bill of electricity is dependent on the units of electricity consumed. The traffic in the street is dependent on the time of the day etc.

The relation may not be as straightforward all the time but they can certainly be equated with an equal sign. 
For example, if a pen costs 2 dollars, two will cost 4 dollars, 3 will cost 6, and so on.

No matter how big the number of pens will be, the price will exactly be twice that. We can choose any value for price of pens, we can find the number of pens. Alternatively we can find the price of pens by using any number of pens.  

To make it easier, we can choose a placeholder variable for both and relate them with an equation. 
price of pens = 2 x (number of pens)

If the number of pens is denoted by ùë•, and their price is denoted by y, then the relationship would be given by;

y=2ùë•

If there are 240 candies to be distributed in a class of t students, the number of candies each student gets can be found out with an equation.

We know that as the number of students increases, the number of candies that each student gets will get lesser and lesser. It's very obvious. 

We know that if there are two students they get 120 candies each, if there are 20 students, each gets 12 candies. We get an interesting type of relationship here. The number of times by which the number of students increases, the candies received by each student decrease by the same factor. In any case the product of the number of students and the candies received by each of them has to amount to 240.

Number of candies each student receives x number of students = total number of candies.

If we replace the Number of candies each student receives with a placeholder p
p x t = 240

Let's suppose another situation where in a university there is one professor each for 20 students. Then, which of the following would be correct?

Is it No. of students = 20 x (No. of professors)
OR, 
No. of professors = 20 x (No. of students)

The easier way of finding the right answer is to understand which is greater, the number of students or professors. If there is one professor for 20 students, two professors for 40 students, etc. It can be seen that students are always more in number than professors.

If the larger number (the number of students) is multiplied by 20, then it will become even larger and the quantity can never be equal to the smaller number (number of professors). Thus the smaller number is multiplied by 20, then it will become equal to the larger number. Thus,

No. of students = 20 x (No. of professors)

If f represents the number of professors and d represents the number of students then 

d=20 x f

The same equation can be written as f=d/20, if we divide both sides of the equation by 20.

Normally when an equation is written, one of the variable is operated while the variable written on the other side is written alone.
In f=d/20, we have to divide d by 20 to get f, so d is independent and f is dependent. Whereas in d=20f, f is independent and d is dependent. How the equation is written doesn't have much effect on the actual relationship between the two quantities.


Let's take another example, 
The height of a rectangular window is 6 inches less than the width. Let w represent the width of the window and h be the height.

We know that 6 is the difference between height and width in which the width is larger so either 6 has to be subtracted from the width or 6 has to be added to the smaller quantity that is the height. 

w-6=h

Or w=h+6 

Here when w=1, we get h=1+6=7

When w=2, we get h=2+6=8
