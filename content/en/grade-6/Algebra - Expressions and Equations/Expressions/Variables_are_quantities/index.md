### Placeholder variables
We found some of the algebraic expressions in the patterns quiz. We found that letters could act as placeholders by substituting in place of a number. Such placeholder symbols or letters are known as variables. 

The kind of letter or symbol we choose is totally independent of whatever quantity we are assuming; it can be any letter or symbol. If we suppose the price of an apple to be p or a, it is just for convenience and not because it represents an abbreviation of the quantity. 

It must also be understood that the letters don't represent the object itself but an attribute of that object. If f  is used in some context involving fish then it may be expressing the weight of fish, the number of fish, the price of fish, or something like that.

Not all letters represent variables, there are letters used as abbreviations for units such as 10 meters is written as 10 m. 20 pounds is written as 20 lb and so on.

It's also not necessary that a particular variable may be used for a particular quantity only. But the same variable cannot be used to depict two different quantities in the same context. 
For example you have the guess the age of two of your cousins. If you choose variable "x" for one of the cousin, the age of the other cousin cant be "x" just because it is unknown as well. The reason being its rare that both numbers turn out be chosen. 

In another example: If the number of oranges is denoted by ‚Äút‚Äù then "t" should not be used again to denote the weight of the oranges in that same scenario.

There are two types of entities in an expression generally: variables and constants. Variables can be used as a placeholder for a quantity whose value isn't fixed and constants are those entities that represent one particular quantity.

One notion may be set up in your mind now that whenever letters are seen in an expression, they are variables. There are certain symbols, particularly Greek, that are used to represent constant values such as œÄ (pi), prominent in formulae related to curved surfaces or circles. It represents 3.14 and is always equal to that value in whatever context it may be used.  Another such symbol is e is known as Euler's number which we will learn about in higher grades. 

Expressions, either numerical or algebraic, carry some value to themselves. It may not always be one particular value, but they represent some quantity (may it be known or unknown). In the case of algebraic expression, we must substitute the variable with a particular value to find the corresponding value of the expression. 

It's not mandatory that some statement or operation in algebra can always be expressed through a combination of variables and constants.
There are many ways of doing that. One such way is with a table or a graph. They both focus on the quantity denoted by the expression. The table is generated by writing down the value of the expresion compared to the value of the variable initially put in. 



It can also be done through tables or graphs. Expressions can be transformed into tables or graphs by finding the potential values of the variable and comparing that with the values of the expression.The expression can also be expressed by a graph where we plot the potential values of expression and the variables. We will learn about that in detail later.

Since an expression corresponds to some quantity, the parts of the expression that form itself are also quantities. Each part can be identified as a separate quantity.


For example: if the cost of 3 pens and 5 notebooks is 3ùë• + 5y then ùë• is the price of one pen or unit price of pen and y is the price of one notebook or unit price of the notebook. 3ùë• is the total price of all pens and 5y is the total price of all notebooks. 
If I tell that I am 2 years older than my brother and 25-2 represents his age, then 25 is my age and 2 represents the difference in the ages between me and my brother.
