### Equivalent expressions
The way of getting simpler expression from a given expression, is done through symbolic transformation. In symbolic transformation, we perform the operations mentioned in the algebraic expressions. We follow the PEMDAS rule for symbolic transformation as well.
Remember when we mentioned that 3 x 4 is the same expression 4 + 4 + 4. That is because both expressions are equal to 12. 
For algebraic expressions, the value of expressions that we obtain by symbolic transformation are equal in all cases. For example, we write 𝑥+𝑥+𝑥 as 3𝑥 using the distributive property. We can choose any value to put in place of 𝑥 and we get the same value for both 𝑥+𝑥+𝑥 and 3𝑥. 

Suppose 𝑥 is taken to be 25,

then 25+25+25 is also 75, and 
3 x 25 is also 75.

If 𝑥 is 3 
then 3+3+3 is also 9 and 
3 x 3 is also 9.

We find the same value for both 𝑥+𝑥+𝑥 and 3𝑥 in all values of 𝑥 and thus they are called equivalent expressions. 

#### Distributive property
The distributive property is the property by which expressions under multiplication/division can be written in the form of addition/subtraction. 
For example 

a(b+c)=ab+ac

(𝑥+z)/y=(𝑥/y) + (z/y)

Here is an example, the area of a purple rectangle is 4 x a because the dimensions of the rectangle are 4 units width and “a” length; The area of a red rectangle is 4 x 3 or 12 because the red rectangle is 4 units wide and 3 units long.

The total area in the figure is 4a +12 if we add both the area of the rectangles. 
If we look at the dimensions of the whole rectangle (red + purple) we find that it is a+3 units long and 4 units wide. Thus the area of the whole rectangle is 4 x (a+3). Both 4 x (a+3) and 4a +12 must be equal. They are equal expressions.

The parentheses are used in place of the multiplication operator. If we want to know the real value of the area of the whole rectangle, then the value of a must be substituted.

Let's suppose that the value of a is 5 units. Then the value of the expression is 4 x (5+3) or 32. The value is the same even if we put a=5 in 4a+12. 

#### Commutative property
The commutative property is another property that helps in finding equivalent expressions. The placing of two quantities doesnt matter if the operation is commutative. Is it hard to understand? 
lets make it easier 

If addition is commutative, a + b is equal to b + a which is true.
If division is commutative, a/b is equal to b/a which is not true. 

The commutative property is valid in a lot of operations such as addition and multiplication whereas is invalid for operations such as subtraction and division. 

lets test the commutative property with numerical values. 

2 + 8 = 10 = 8 + 2 

2 - 8 =-6 ≠6= 8 - 2

If two expressions give the same value for only some of the numbers then such expressions aren't equivalent to each other. 5𝑥 and 𝑥-8 give equal values only when 𝑥 = -2, 

5𝑥 = 5 x -2 =-10

𝑥-8 = -2 -8 = -10

That means these expressions are called equal expressions at 𝑥 = -2. 

We can try any other value for 𝑥 such as 7

5𝑥 = 5 x 7 =35

𝑥-8 = 7 -8 = -1

Just like 35≠-1, at all other values for 𝑥, these two expressions will have different values. So these expressions can't be termed as equivalent expressions.
